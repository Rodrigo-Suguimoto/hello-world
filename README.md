# hello-world
I am just learning how to code :)

I am twenty two years old and I am from Brazil, I study Biotechnology Engineering and I really love tech :)

I'm getting into the #100DaysOfCode challenge and that's why I'm here because it's where I'll log my daily challenges through learning how to code!
